**Overview**

This workshop will explore Artificial Intelligence and Statistical Learning algorithms and techniques for biological applications. The objective of this workshop is to bring together LANL scientists from the various divisions to present the latest AI-driven biology LANL research efforts and to identify challenges and future directions in applying AI in biological research.

This is an open in-person workshop; no sign-up is required. We will also send the weblink to those who wish to connect remotely closer to the workshop date.



**Dates**: August 26th and August 27th

**Location**: CNLS conference room, LANL

**Sponsor**: Center for Nonlinear Studies (CNLS) 

**Email**: Email ai-bio@lanl.gov to get a Microsoft Teams weblink (different for each day) if you wish to connect remotely.
